# Many-things
## In this project, I'm drawing a singer singing on stage, and his fans are waving his hands on the bottom, and ribbon's are falling of the sky, and there's a sun glowing in the background
## How to achieve this:
### Use the function to define a unique shape for the fans, and use the function to draw multiple fans.
### Use the sin and cos function to make the fan wave their hand back and forth
### Make their light stick change color randomly
### Use dy and dx to make the ribbons fall from the sky,
### Make the sun glowing by using the breathing function, changing the shape of the sun.
