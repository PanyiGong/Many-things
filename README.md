# Many-things
## In this project, I'm drawing a singer singing on stage, and his fans are waving his hands on the bottom, and ribbon's are falling of the sky, and there's a sun glowing in the background
## How to achieve this:
### Use the function to define a unique shape for the fans, and use the function to draw multiple fans. Use two functions to draw two different types of fan, so the picture looks more diverse.
### Use the sin and cos function to make the fan wave their hand back and forth.
### Make their light stick change color overtime, using the RGB value and +=
### Use dy and dx to make the ribbons fall from the sky, make the length of the ribbon random so that the picture doesn't look singular
### Use simple shapes, such as quad, circle, and stroke to draw the singer and the microphone
### Add offset to the swinging of the fans. Because in reality, fans do not swing their arm at the same rate.
### Make the sun glow by using the breathing function, changing the shape of the sun.
